# Blog Runner

## A lightweight static site generator for bloggers built for the JavaScript environment.

### Built and maintained by [Alex Pearson](https://alexpear.com)


Blog Runner is a simple static site generator that includes basic templating and Markdown support, built as a bare-bones replacement for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Blog Runner is built on top of the [`mustache.js`](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) templating library and the [`marked`](https://github.com/chjj/marked) Markdown parser. The latest build can be seen in action on the author's blog: [alexpear.com](https://alexpear.com).


## Installation

Blog Runner is packaged as an `npm` module. The package can be installed globally for use from the command-line or as a `devDependency` in your project's `package.json` file.
